      Frontend developer with 6+ years of proven impact across insurance, IoT, and real estate domains. I've led the
      development of 3 full-scale Angular and React apps, created 40+ reusable components that slashed dev time by 30%,
      and resolved 100+ production issues with zero rollbacks. At Acuity Brands, I drove micro frontend adoption and
      maintained 80%+ test coverage. At Swiss RE, I delivered enterprise-grade UI with flawless cross-browser support. I
      don't just ship code â€” I make products faster, cleaner, and more scalable. Hire me, or hire someone I'll
      outperform.
