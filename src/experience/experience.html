            I am a seasoned UI Developer with over
            6+ years of experience building dynamic,
            high-performance web applications using Angular and React.
            Throughout my career, I have contributed to the success of
            large-scale enterprise projects across domains such as insurance,
            banking, reinsurance, and smart lighting.
            My work has spanned end-to-end frontend
            development—ranging from implementing responsive
            UI components and reusable modules to ensuring
            cross-browser compatibility and seamless integration with backend systems.
